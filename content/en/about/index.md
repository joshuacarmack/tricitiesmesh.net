Tri-Cities Mesh is a grassroots project bringing together amateur radio operators, makers, and technology enthusiasts across Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol.  
Our goal is to build a resilient, community-owned communication network that works even when cell towers or the internet are unavailable.

# Our Mission

We believe communication should be **simple, reliable, and accessible to everyone**.  
By using low-power LoRa radios, we create long-range mesh links that support text messaging, GPS location sharing, and data transport—without monthly fees or dependence on traditional infrastructure.

# How It Started

In 2025, a few local ham radio operators discovered the Meshtastic project and recognized its potential.  
They saw it as both **an exciting experiment in radio technology** and a **practical tool for community preparedness**.  
From those first test nodes, Tri-Cities Mesh was born—built on the idea that anyone can take part in expanding the network and making it stronger.
