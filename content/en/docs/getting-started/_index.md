   Use the official [Meshtastic firmware flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org/) to update your device.

4. **Connect & Configure**  
   Pair your node with the app and set your channel settings to match the Tri-Cities Mesh.

5. **Join the Network**  
   Power it on, and youâ€™re now part of the mesh!
