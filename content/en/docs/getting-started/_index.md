## Welcome

This page will help you take your first steps with **Tri-Cities Mesh**.  
Whether youâ€™re completely new or just looking to connect a new device, start here.

---

## What Youâ€™ll Need

- A Meshtastic-compatible device (such as a T-Beam or LoRa32 board).  
- A smartphone (iOS or Android) with the [Meshtastic app](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/android).  
- A basic understanding of how to power and connect your device.

---

## First Steps

1. **Get a device**  
   Purchase or build a LoRa node (see our recommended hardware list â€” coming soon).

2. **Install the app**  
   Download the Meshtastic app on your phone.

3. **Flash the firmware**  
   Use the official [Meshtastic firmware flasher](https://flasher.meshtastic.org/) to update your device.

4. **Connect & Configure**  
   Pair your node with the app and set your channel settings to match the Tri-Cities Mesh.

5. **Join the Network**  
   Power it on, and youâ€™re now part of the mesh!  
   Try sending a message or checking the map to see other connected nodes.
