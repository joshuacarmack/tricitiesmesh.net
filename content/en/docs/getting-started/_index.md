## Join the Tri-Cities Meshtastic Network

Meshtastic is a **low-power, long-range communication system** that lets you send text messages and data without cell service or Wi-Fi.  
Itâ€™s easy to get started, and by setting up a node youâ€™ll help expand coverage across **Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol**.

This guide will walk you through choosing the right hardware, setting up your node, and connecting to the network.

---

## Step 1: Get Your Hardware

To join the network, youâ€™ll need a **LoRa radio device** that runs the Meshtastic firmware. Popular options include:

- **LilyGO T-Echo** â€“ Small, all-in-one with built-in screen and battery. Great for portable use.  
- **LilyGO T-Beam** â€“ Long battery life, built-in GPS, and great for mobile or stationary use.  
- **Heltec V3 LoRa Boards** â€“ Compact, low-power, and great for DIY setups.  
- **RAK Wireless Modules** â€“ Excellent for solar-powered or high-performance relay nodes.  

ðŸ‘‰ *Where to buy:* Amazon, AliExpress, or directly from **[RAK Wireless](https://store.rakwireless.com/)**.

## Step 2: Flash the Meshtastic Firmware

Your device must run the Meshtastic firmware:

1. **Use the Meshtastic Flasher** â€“ [Flasher Tool](https://flasher.meshtastic.org/)  
2. **Install the firmware** â€“ Connect your device to your computer via USB and run the flasher.  
3. **Install the app** â€“ Download the Meshtastic app (Android, iOS, or Desktop) and connect to your device via Bluetooth or USB.  

---

## Step 3: Configure Your Node

Once your device is flashed, adjust a few settings:

- **LoRa Region** â†’ Select **US 915 MHz** (for United States).  
- **Device Name** â†’ Helps others recognize your node.  
- **Channels** â†’ Join the default chat or create a custom group channel.  

---

## Step 4: Deploy Your Node

Decide if your node will be **mobile** or **fixed**:

**Mobile Node (personal use)**  
- Charge the battery or use a USB power bank.  
- Carry your Meshtastic device in your backpack or vehicle.  
- Communicate with other users in range!  

**Fixed Node (network expansion)**  
- Place your node at **high elevation** for maximum coverage.  
- Power with USB adapter, solar panel, or external battery.  
- Weatherproof with an outdoor case if mounted outside.  

---

## Step 5: Start Communicating!

Once online, you can:

- Chat with others on the network.  
- Send/relay messages where cell coverage doesnâ€™t reach.  
- Share GPS location (if enabled).  
- Help strengthen reliability for everyone.  

---

## Want to Do More?

- **Host a relay** â€“ A tower, tall building, or mountaintop node greatly boosts coverage.  
- **Support expansion** â€“ Donate gear, host a site, or join field testing.  
- **Connect with us** â€“ [Join our community](/community/) to share your setup, get help, and discuss improvements.
