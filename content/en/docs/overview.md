## What is Tri-Cities Mesh?

Tri-Cities Mesh is a community-driven, off-grid communication network powered by **Meshtastic**.  
Using small LoRa radios, it enables long-range, low-power messaging without needing cell towers, internet, or traditional infrastructure.

Our mission is simple: **connect people across Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol**—for outdoor adventures, community events, emergency preparedness, or just experimenting with mesh networking technology.

## Why it matters

- **Resilient:** Works even when cell service or internet is down.  
- **Community-powered:** Coverage grows as more people add nodes.  
- **Accessible:** Low-cost radios make it easy to get started.  
- **Educational:** A hands-on way to explore wireless networking.  

It’s not meant for high-bandwidth use like streaming or calls, but it’s excellent for reliable text communication and data sharing.
