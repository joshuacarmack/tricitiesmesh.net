## Current Iteration (as of 10/6/2025)


![Node on the tower](IMG_2935.jpg)

The node was reinstalled on 10/6/2025 with a new RAK node and enclosure with a 900MHz cavity filter to try and mitigate the noise and issues the node has been having with reception. 

We are going to redo the mounting and try and mount the node 3' off of the tower to see if that helps because currently it is still not working. It will transmit all day long but not receive anything.
