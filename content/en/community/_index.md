<h2>Help Build a Stronger Network—Join Us in Expanding Tri-Cities Mesh Coverage!</h2>
{{% /blocks/lead %}}

{{< blocks/section color="white" >}}
<p>Do you have access to a location like a water tower, tall building, church steeple, or radio tower? That spot could be the key to extending and strengthening the Tri-Cities Mesh network.</p>

<p>By hosting a Meshtastic node at one of these vantage points, you’ll help connect neighborhoods, expand coverage across Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol, and make off-grid communication more accessible for everyone. Whether you're a ham radio operator, maker, outdoor enthusiast, or simply someone who wants to support better connectivity, your help is needed!</p>

<p><strong>Let’s work together!</strong> Reach out today at <a href="mailto:contact@tricitiesmesh.net">contact@tricitiesmesh.net</a> to learn how you can contribute to the network. Every node strengthens our community and pushes the boundaries of open communication.</p>
